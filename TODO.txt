Comments from MCO2:
- allow user to create posts with image attachments
- redirect the user to login on succesful register, 
    and/or inform the user that the registration was successful (already implemented tho?)

done: 
x include date of post / comment create in post and comment components 
x would be better if create post form fields are hidden until a button is pressed
