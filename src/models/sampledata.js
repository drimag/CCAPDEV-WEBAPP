Honestly because it was W1 and history of kpop groups having members that are rarely utilised my expectations for everyone except Haobin + matthew was pretty low but they gave everyone such good lines and parts in the MV?? I was legit shocked by how they decided to distribute the lines for each member but it turned out so good!!",

I love the rhythm and Jungkook's voice and how it carries so smoothly and I just know he's going to devour it when he performs it live because those vocals of his are just that extraordinary. Also, it's catchy. I have a love-hate relationship with catchy songs but goddamn Jeon Jungkook he just never misses. Also LATTO'S PART???? Ive never listened to her music but holy I loved her part, I know what I'm gonna be repeating like a broken CD player for the next few weeks lol",

I will probably be going to the Chicago one but I don't have info on it. Also ticket master says there's no info on it either. Ticket master overall is confusing. Help pleaseðŸ˜­",
