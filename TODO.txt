Comments from MCO2:
- redirect the user to login on succesful register, 
    and/or inform the user that the registration was successful (already implemented tho?)

reminder:
- vote functionality on profile
- nav dropdown not working in profile

done: 
x allow user to create posts with image attachments (jaeme)
x include date of post / comment create in post and comment components (jaeme)
x would be better if create post form fields are hidden until a button is pressed (jaeme)
